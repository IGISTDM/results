# results

This repo contains the style transfer result of 
- [our method](https://github.com/IGISTDM/docs/blob/master/report.pdf)
- [Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868) (metioned as AdaIN through all of our repos)
- [Exploring the structure of a real-time, arbitrary neural artistic stylization network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06830) (metioned as RAASN through all of our repos)

## 4 styles and 6 styles ?

As mentioned in [experiment](https://github.com/IGISTDM/experiment), we select 6 styles for style transfer, however we were unable to finish the style transfer of our method on time, so that's why there are only 4 styles in the IGISTDM directory in this repo and in the [analysis graph](https://github.com/IGISTDM/loss_cal/tree/master/analysis) as well.
